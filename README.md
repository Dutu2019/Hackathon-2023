This is an online chess playing website using React as frontend and ExpressJS along with SocketIO as backend. The players' accounts are stored in a SQL database. The client and server folders are completely seperate. Installing dependencies with npm i in both folders will make you able to host the servers with npm start or nodemon. Also, I might have left my private IP address in the code, so make sure to update it with your own if you want to try hosting the web app.
